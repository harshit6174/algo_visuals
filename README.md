# algo_visuals
This project demonstrates the visualization of shortest path finding algorithms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interactively see how different algorithms finds the shortest path between two points on a grid.

## Features
### Visualization of Algorithm: 
See how the shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm) works step-by-step on a grid.
### Interactive Grid: 
Users can place start and end points, as well as obstacles, on the grid to observe how the algorithm navigates around them.
### Customizable Algorithms: 
Easily switch between different shortest path algorithms to compare their efficiency and paths found.
